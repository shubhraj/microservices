📘 Chapter 1: Introduction to Microservices
🔍 What Are Microservices?
Microservices are a way to build software as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over APIs. Each service is:

Independent: Can be deployed or updated without affecting others.

Single Responsibility: Does one thing (e.g., User Management).

Communicates via lightweight protocols (like HTTP or messaging).

📦 Real-World Analogy
Think of an online store:

User Service: Handles login/signup

Product Service: Manages product catalog

Cart Service: Tracks what users want to buy

Order Service: Places and tracks orders

Each of these can be developed, scaled, and deployed independently.

🧠 Advantages
Easier to maintain and scale

Faster deployments

Technology flexibility

Isolation of faults

⚠️ Disadvantages
Complex inter-service communication

Debugging becomes harder

DevOps and monitoring overhead
